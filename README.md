## Quick Code

Quick Code is a Unity editor extension for quickly create and run functions of any complexity, without the need to create separate scripts and compile them.

Quick Code can be used at all stages of project development. For example, you need to rename all objects with a specific component, generate random positions or scale for objects or for example generate a mesh and also can be used for testing, debugging and etc.
